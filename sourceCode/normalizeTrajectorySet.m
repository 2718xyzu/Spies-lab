%A wrapper function to guide through data input from raw intensity values
%to "emulated FRET", a normalized version of the signal which can be
%imported to ebFRET, HaMMY, or other programs which assume you will be
%feeding them a FRET signal.
%Contains call to selectTracesEmFret, which allows for trace pre-processing,
%before calling smoothNormalize (if no baselines were selected) or normalizeSelection
%(preferred; uses user input data to help normalize) which smooth and normalize all traces
