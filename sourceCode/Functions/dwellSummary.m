function out = dwellSummary(dataCell,timeInterval,channels,baseState)
%Generates the dwellSummary from the dwell and time information; this code
%may be easily changed to add more information to the eventual output.
%dwellSummary is a structure, so just add a field to it.  See documentation
%for more details, but in brief, the structure is organized first by
%channel, then by states within the channel.  The dwells *with* edges
%include the states which are on the edge of the trace (beginning or end);
%in the dwellTimes field it discards those times because we don't know how
%long they lasted.  For determining the propoprtion of time your system
%spent at a given state, though, definitely use the dwellTimesWithEdges so
%you aren't biased by any state being more likely to happen at the
%beginning or end.  Multiplying the meanDwellsWithEdges values by the
%length of the respective dwellTimesWithEdges is a fast way to figure out
%how long your system was at those states.
