function [finalDiscrete] = autoDeadTime(raw, discrete, deadFrames)
%Not really in use by KERA


%Function to intelligently fill events which are shorter than a length of
%(deadFrames+1).  Mostly, this is intended to fill single-frame gaps due to
%noise, such as [1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 ] where it is unambiguous where the
%jump belongs (replace 2 with 1 in the above example).  However, it is
%conceivable that an event such as [1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 3 ] could become [1 1 1 1
%3 3 3 3 3].  In the cases where a short event is nearly the length of
%(deadFrames+1), it is fair to ask whether it should in fact be lengthened;
%In that case, [1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 ] might become [1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3].
%Gaussian priors for each state based on the individual trace are used to
%create a maximum-likelihood estimate for the solution which eliminates
%short events


%raw: a 1xN array of raw trace values (the data before discretization)
%discrete: a 1xN array of integers (the discretized data; the states)
%deadFrames: the length of events to be eliminated (minimum: 1)
