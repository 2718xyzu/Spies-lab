function [baseline,standardDev] = getIntensityCoefficients(validDots,frame)
    %validDots is a variable in the calling function which contains the
    %locations and identities of all dots being saved
    %It is important to remember to call this function using the unadjusted
    %version of the pma file, called frame2, as the second argument
    for i = 1:size(validDots,1)
        x0 = validDots(i,1);
        y0 = validDots(i,2);
        x1 = round(x0);
        y1 = round(y0);
        slice = double(frame(y1-2:y1+2,x1-2:x1+2,:));
        intensityi = getIntensity(slice, x0, y0); %Intensity at every frame
        standardDev(i) = std(intensityi);
        baseline(i) = mean(intensityi); %mean of those intensities; every trace
                                        %is then divided by its respective baseline (happens outside the
                                        %function)
